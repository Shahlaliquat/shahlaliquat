# Hi, I'm Shahla Liaquat 👋
### ⚛️ Computational Physicist | AI for Science

I bridge the gap between **Condensed Matter Physics** and **Generative AI**.
My research focuses on building **software infrastructure for Self-Driving Labs**, using Deep Learning to accelerate the discovery of renewable energy materials.

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Generative VAEs for Inverse Material Design.
- 🔬 **Research Interest:** Materials Informatics, Autonomous Screening Agents, Bayesian Optimization.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Open-source tools for Computational Materials Science.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I use code to "dream" up new crystals that don't exist yet!
